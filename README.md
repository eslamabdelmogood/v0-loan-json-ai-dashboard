## LoanJSON AI Dashboard:

Standardizing Loan Intelligence. Powering Smarter Lending Decisions.

LoanJSON AI Dashboard is a desktop-first, commercially viable prototype built for the LMA Edge Hackathon.
It introduces a unified JSON-based loan standard combined with AI-powered insights to simplify how loans are originated, monitored, and risk-assessed across financial institutions.
